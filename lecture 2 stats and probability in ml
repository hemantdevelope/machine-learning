1.WHAT IS DATA?
-->Data refers to facts and statistics collected together for reference and analysis

2.CATEGORIES OF DATA
-->1.Qualitative data(deals with characteristics and descriptors that cant be easily measured,but can be observed subjectively)
        1.1 Nominal data:data with no order or ranking 
        1.2 Ordinal data:data with an ordered series (like with customer id)
        
   2.Quantitative data(deals with numbers and things which can be measured)
           2.1 Discrete data:can hold finite number of values(no of students in a class)
           2.2 Continuous data:can hold infinite number of values(weight on a person)


3.WHAT IS STATISTICS?
-->area of applied mathematics concerned with the data collection,analysis,interpretation and presentation



4.BASIC TERMINOLOGIES IN STATISTICS
-->Population: collection of sset of indivisuals or ojects or events whose properties is to be analysed
   Sample:subset of population


5.SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
-->1.probability
        1.1 random:each member of population has an equal chance to be selected for sample
        1.2 systematic:every nth record is choose from the population to be part of the sample
        1.3 stratified:it divide the population in different parts according to its patterns and select from those patterns(eg on the basis of gender)
        
   2.non-probability
       2.1 snowball
       2.2 quota
       2.3 judgement
       2.4 convenience


6.TYPES OF STATISTICS(advance)
-->1.Descriptive
   2.inferential


7.DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS(on a sample)
-->it focus on characteristics of data.it provides graphical sample data
    7.1 measures of central tendency:
        7.1.1 mean
        7.1.2 median: center or middle value of data (even and odd)
        7.1.3 mode
        
    7.2 measures of variability(spread):
        7.2.1 Range:max - min
        7.2.2 inter Quartile range:(quartile break data in quarters) q3 - q1
        7.2.3 variance:how much the random variable differs from its expected value.
        7.2.4 standard deviation:(deviation is the difference between each element froom the mean)(std. deviation is the measure of dispersio of a set of data from the mean)

8.PROBABILITY
-->


9.INFERETIAL STATISTICS(uses sample data to predict for the large population)
-->
10INFORMATION GAIN AND ENTROPY
-->ENTROPY: measure of uncertainity in dataset
   INFORMATION GAIN: indicates how much information a particular feature/variable give us about the final outcome
11 USE CASE
-->pblm:wheather forcast for game to be played

12 CONFUSION MATRIX
-->IT is used in classification model to describe its performance
   NO YES
 NO
 YES
 
13 PROBABILITY
--> it is mathematical model used in statistics.
    RANDOM EXPERIMENT: An experiment or process for which the outcome can not be predicted with certainty
    SAMPLE SPACE: entire possible set of outcome of a random experiment 
    EVENT: one or more outcome of an experiment,subset of sample space
    
    eg rolling a dice and getting even no
       random experiment: rolling a dice
       set of all possible outcome: sample space
       gettting even no : event
14 TYPES OF EVENT:
        1.DISJOINT
        2.NON-DISJOINT
        
 15 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
        15.1 PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION: the equation describing a continuous probability distribution is called a probability density fun
        15.2 NORMAL DISTIBUTION/Gaussian dist.:
        15.3 CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM:
  16 TYPE OF PROBABILITY
          16.1 MARGINAL PROBABILITY:accurance of single event
          16.2 JOINT PROBABILITY:two events at a time
          16.3 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY:currrent event probability based on privious event
          
          USE CASE FOR 16
          
   18 BAYES THEOREM(USED IN SPAM FILTERING)
